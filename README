Skeleton is a small lightweight PHP framework that i've wrote over the years, to use it in my projects.
It is a MVC framework. It supports code generation (php bin/console/generate.php [table]).
To set-up, modify config.ini,  to suit your needs (path and database).
run sh create_tmp.sh to setup initial temporary files.

Controllers are located in controllers/ folder, models are in models/, views are in views/main/
You can create for example [users] table and cd to bin/console.
Run [php generate.php users] to generate controller/model/views for it.
